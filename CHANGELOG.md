# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## [In Development] - Unreleased

### Added

- Image sizes to the character portrait image HTML tags
- Forum search via Discord command (`/forum_search [<search_phrase>]`). You need to
  have `allianceauth-discordbot` ([Link](https://github.com/pvyParts/allianceauth-discordbot))
  installed, configured and active for this feature to work.

### Fixed

- A CSS class in an image HTML tag


## [1.8.0] - 2022-04-14

### Added

- New Feature: Announcement Boards
  ![New Feature: Announcement Boards](aa_forum/docs/images/feature-announcement-board.jpg "New Feature: Announcement Boards")
  - Boards marked as "Announcement Boards" have restrictions on who can start a topic
    in them. This is the already known group restriction function that is already
    used to restrict access to boards in general
  - Users with access to an announcement board still can discuss the topic itself
  - To start a topic, a user needs to be in (at least) one of the defined groups that
    are allowed to start topics
  - If no groups are defined that are allowed to start topics in the announcement
    board, only users with the `manage_forum` permission (Forum Admins) can start topics
  - These settings will not be inherited in child boards


## [1.7.0] - 2022-03-02

### Added

- Test suite for AA 3.x and Django 4

### Changed

- Switched to `setup.cfg` as config file, since `setup.py` is deprecated now

### Removed

- Deprecated settings


## [1.6.0] - 2022-02-28

### Fixed

- Compatibility Fixes (AA 3.x / Django 4):
  - ImportError: cannot import name 'ugettext_lazy' from 'django.utils.translation'
  - URL config in README updated to work with Django 4. **Please make sure to update
    your configuration accordingly!**


## [1.5.1] - 2022-01-26

### Fixed

- Escaped HTML entities in webhook messages, so that this »`That&#39;s`« does not
  happen anymore


## [1.5.0] - 2022-01-24

### Added

- Option: Use this Discord Webhook for replies as well? (This is a checkbox in the
  board settings. When checked, the provided Discord webhook will also be used to
  send a message for every reply in this board to Discord. Chose wisely!)
  ![Admin Board Options](aa_forum/docs/images/admin-board-options.jpg)

### Changed

- Webhook handling changed to dhooks-lite, so we can make our Discord messages nicer


## [1.4.3] - 2022-01-24

### Fixed

- `NoReverseMatch` error when slugs for a category, board or topic that are generated
  from the name/subject ended up being empty when only entered special chars like
  "@#$%" as name/subject


## [1.4.2] - 2022-01-23

### Fixed

- Deleting the last topic of a child board results in a `NoReverseMatch` error on
  the index page (Thanks @ErikKalkoken)

### Changed

- Refactoring of logic for updating first and last message on board and topic
  (Thanks @ErikKalkoken)
- Demoted `Board.update_last_message()` and `Topic.update_last_message()` to private
  methods. Those should no longer be called from outside the module, because they
  are called implicitly by `save()` and `delete()` when needed. Except for bulk
  methods, where e.g. `save()` is not called automatically. Test now also no longer
  test this method directly. (Thanks @ErikKalkoken)


## [1.4.1] - 2022-01-19
